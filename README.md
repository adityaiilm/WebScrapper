# Web Scraper using JavaFX

## Introduction
This project is a web scraper developed by students of IILM University using JavaFX. The web scraper automates the extraction of data from websites, enabling efficient data collection for analysis and insights.

## Features
- **JavaFX UI:** Utilizes JavaFX for a rich user interface.
- **WebView Component:** Embeds web pages directly into the application.
- **Interactive Interface:** Allows user interaction for initiating and inputting scraping tasks.
- **Data Extraction:** Uses JavaScript execution in WebView to handle dynamic content extraction.
- **Error Handling:** Implements proper error handling for network errors and timeouts.

## Implementation
The web scraper is implemented using JavaFX components and WebView functionality. Here is a simplified example of how the scraping functionality can be achieved:

## Challenges and Solutions
-- **Dynamic Content:** Handles dynamic content using JavaScript execution in WebView.
-- **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Rotates user agents and IP addresses for anonymity and avoids scraping restricted content.
-- **Ethical Considerations:** Respects website terms and conditions, ensuring ethical and legal use of scraped data.
## Use Cases
**Price monitoring for e-commerce.**
**Market research and trend analysis.**
**Data aggregation for news and content websites.**
## Conclusion
The web scraper based on JavaFX developed by IILM University students provides a powerful tool for automated data extraction with a user-friendly interface and ethical scraping practices.
